# General Notes

miscellaneous questions to for meetings with supervisor 

## Questions to be asked

ğŸ“… 14.04.2025

J's input : will this work: for ablation study using different encoder for the contrastive loss and supervised loss

## Meeting Notes

ğŸ“… 07.04.2025 

FIT: first idea: everyone who listens should understand the basic problem setting

diff between combined training vs two stage training

background knowledge : pre training is mostly unsupervised

two stage training: copying pretrain weights and do ft

combined training: train both losses at the same time

test performance differences between combined training and two-stage training -- research question 

systematic difference

is there a systematic diff between these two

overview of planned experiments

one contrastive learning paper 

give a hint in planned experiments and we will test different pre training 

one of reconstruction loss, jigsaw puzzle, denoising autoencoder 

test code
